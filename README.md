# Time Series Project
This project looks at 2 time series with heteroskedasticity. Results from the application of Jacque-Bera Test, Ljung-Box tests, ARCH LM tests, etc. suggests that ARMA-GARCH models are satisfactory. Optimal coefficients (via CMLE) are found. Finally, results of 100-ahead forecasts and rolling forecasts of returns & unconditional standard deviation are discussed.
